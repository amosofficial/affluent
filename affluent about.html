    <h2>Our story:Why we exist today</h2>
    <P>
        Affluent Farmers is an Agro-Consultancy and Agro-Supplies Firm located in Nairobi, Kenya.Affluent Farmers, AF,
        started as a Facebook Page intended to offer farmers the most credible,reliable, comprehensive, and up-to-date
        agriculture information. The effort was aimed atbridging the agricultural knowledge gap that hindered farmers
        and potential farmers fromachieving their maximum potential.

    </P>
    <p>We dubbed our page Affluent Farmers to illustrate the fact that, unlike a common perception,mostly associating
        agriculture with the poor or the peasants, farming can, actually, be a source ofaffluence.

    </p>

    <p>
        In so doing, we mainly targets the youth who, the society have for a long time, erroneously,made believe that
        farming is for the elderly. Similarly, we focus on women groups, whomimplications of gender disparities and the
        patriarchal society nature disadvantages, leaving themunemployed, without enough farming land, and totally
        incapable of fending their families.

    </p>

    <p>
        Affluent Farmers, therefore, intended to come up with a solution to the problems facing theyouth and women
        groups, mainly through creating awareness on the importance of adoptingmodern agricultural techniques and
        feasible agricultural projects.

    </p>

    <p>
        As a result, Affluent Farmers became selective, only picking agribusiness projects that we feltare most suitable
        and/or viable for the youth and women regardless of their employment status,size of land owned, geographical
        location, education level, among other aspects that couldimplicate on farming outcomes.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, we promote the adoption of ventures like Mushrooms and Rabbit farming. Theseprojects, among the
        others that Affluent Farmers has chosen, require low starting capital on asmall scale, relatively little spaces/
        land, do well both in rural and urban areas including indoors,have unmet market demands, among other factors
        that make them viable for small scale farmerswho wish to start small and grow.

    </p>
    <p>
        Following months of sharing agricultural information, we realized the interest and great impactthat we had on
        our audience. This pushed and encouraged Affluent Farmers to start offeringconsultancy services to interested
        farmers as a way of bringing a one on one aspect of theinformation sharing idea. Consequently, a business idea
        was hatched. Notably, not an ordinarybusiness but, one aimed at empowering and building capacities of the youth
        and women groups,generally marginalized in the society.

    </p>
    <p>
        As we grew, prospects became more interested, requesting for farm inputs on the ventures in ourscope of
        operation. The demand prompted us to work with like-minded agripreneurs to help meetthe farmers&#39; needs for
        high-quality farm inputs, crop varieties, and animal breeds. AffluentFarmers&#39; endeavor is so far a success
        with many people in Kenya, the East Africa region, andbeyond benefiting from our services.

    </p>
    <p>
        As we grow, our objectives are to continue sharing comprehensive agricultural information to allwithout limit or
        holding back. At AF we believe that information is power, and that with genuineagribusiness information, we can
        grow a sustainable society that is food secure, healthy, and thatenjoys a considerable standard of living.

    </p>
    <p>
        To promote the poor rural farmers, we provide absolutely free consultancy services to registeredfarmers groups.
        This is in an effort to, also, encourage other farmers to unite and have a single,strong voice of a multitude
        that not only enhances their bargaining power in buying farm inputsbut also in marketing their produce, by
        easily eliminating the middle-men.

    </p>
    <p>
        In the same spirit, we continue sharing information free of charge to all our audience, throughour social media
        platforms like Facebook and Twitter. We also share modern farming guidelines,news, trends, and insights on our
        website, in a variety of areas not only covering farming but alsohuman and environmental health. We are strong
        advocates of environmental conservation andpractices aimed at mitigating climate change.

    </p>
    <p>
        Our consultancy services are affordable to ensure that our clients find no stumbling block;through a hefty price
        for information, to realize their agribusiness goals. The fees charged in ourindividual clients&#39; training
        courses, alongside the earnings from agro-input supplies helps sustainthe AF business.

    </p>
    <p>
        Also, to keep growing, and to benefit more needy farmers, we encourage well-wishers to keepsponsoring our
        projects for a good course. Our aims, are not to make more money, but to upliftunderprivileged, but able farmers
