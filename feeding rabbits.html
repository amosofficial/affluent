<h2>A Brief on Feeding Your Rabbits</h2>
<p>Feeding your rabbits well is one of the success factors in rearing rabbits for business. But, do not get anxious! Rabbits do not feed much compared to other farm animals. You can, therefore, easily raise them for subsistence or commercial purposes. Which is a good thing!</p>

<p>Making a wrong choice of rabbit feeds could be disastrous to your animals. However, this occurs rarely in rabbits- whereby food poisoning, for example, may result. To avoid such worse scenarios, you should have some basics on rabbit feeds. This article will have you sorted. </p>

<p>Welcome..</p>
<p>First, allow me to mention the most important parts of rabbit feeds. Later, I will discuss materials or substances that you should not feed your rabbits.</p>
<p>Essentially, one of the most crucial components of a rabbit diet is fiber. Fiber contains cellulose which is an essential component for rabbit's survival.</p>

<p>Unlike other animals, which find it hard to digest cellulose, rabbits have a caecum with special bacteria for digesting cellulose. Interestingly, the digestible material is first excreted in feaces and then ingested back into the system by the rabbit consuming it in feaces as cecotropes or cecal pellets.</p>

<p>So, where do you get this important component of rabbit feeds?</p>
<p>Worry not. Hay has a lot of fiber- containing the cellulose required by the rabbits to grow healthy and mature fast. Fresh hay, for instance, should make up the largest part of your rabbits' diet.</p>

<p>In addition to hay, you can feed your rabbits with pellets, as well as fresh vegetables. If raising your rabbits in the upcountry, you can find the specific herbs (mostly weeds), that farmers use to feed rabbits to supplement hay and the pellets.</p>

<p>NB: Some weeds or herbs can be poisonous to your rabbits. If you cannot find a farmer already using, or knowledgeable about the plants to feed the rabbits, stick to hay, pellets, and vegetables like cabbages and kale.</p>

<p>Also, make sure the herbs or weeds are not sprayed with any herbicide as this could spell doom to your animals. This holds true, even to the hay you feed the rabbits. Ensure that it is from a reliable source.</p>

<p>If you want your rabbit rearing business to thrive, avoid the following plant materials. The materials adversely affect the health of rabbits in diverse ways including causing food poisoning and digestive system breakdowns. 

</p>
<h5>1.grains</h5>
<p>Avoid feeding your rabbits with grains like maize and rice- as these high-carbohydrate content disrupts rabbits' digestive system.</p>
<h5>2.Nightshades</h5>
<p>Avoid nightshade plants including potatoes, tomatoes, and peppers, as they could be toxic to rabbits.</p>
<h5>3.avocados</h5>
<p>All parts of avocados are said to be poisonous to rabbits.</p>
<h5>4. Peas</h5>
<p>Avoid feeding your rabbits peas due to the high sugar and phosphorous content. The plant is not toxic though.</p>
<h5>5. Do not feed them with onion and garlic.</h5>
<p>Also, be careful when feeding your rabbits any kind of fruits unless you are absolutely certain that the fruit is beneficial to the animals. Most fruits including apple, plums and mango contains traces of Cyanide which, depending with the amounts, could be toxic to rabbits.</p>
<p>NB: Rabbits have a sensitive digestive system. One wrong move in feeding could lead to devastating losses.</p>
<p>Keep following as we keep you updated on feeding rabbits in upcoming articles.</p>
<p>Specifically, we will discuss the challenges facing rabbit farmers including diseases, food poisoning, among others.</p>
